# Gradient Descent Animation (for m & b)

 -> This project visualizes the working of **Gradient Descent** for a **Simple Linear Regression** model, showing how both **slope (m)** and **intercept (b)** get updated in each              iteration.


## Objective:-

 -> To gain an **intuitive understanding** of how gradient descent minimizes the cost function and converges towards optimal values of `m` and `b`.


## Libraries Used:-

-> python
-> numpy 
-> matplotlib
